This project analyzes historical gold price data, offering insights into price movements across various trading sessions. Each entry in the dataset corresponds to a specific time window, capturing key metrics such as price and trading volume.

Gold, as a globally traded commodity, serves as an indicator of economic trends, currency fluctuations, and geopolitical events. Through this analysis, we aim to:

- Identify long-term trends in gold prices.
- Assess market volatility using daily highâ€“low price ranges.
- Examine the correlation between trading volume and price changes.
- Develop predictive models for forecasting future price movements.
